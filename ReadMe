This is a port of the classic version of boost::spirit to the D programming language.

If you know what spirit is, you can pretty much just dive right in and start using spiritd.
Otherwise go read the http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/spirit/classic/index.html
spirit documentation first.

This port is also Boost licensed:

	Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See accompanying
	file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

Differences to c++

There is no operator overloading in spiritd due to the lack of global operators.
Instead there are some convenience template functions to create composite
parsers in spirit.factory. Have a look at the example 'test0.d'
